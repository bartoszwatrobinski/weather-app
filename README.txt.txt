In order for the weather app to run successfully, the following 4 files: temp.png, humid.png, windspd.png and calendar.png must be saved in this location: src/assets/icons

Additionally these following 8 files: garden-iphone.jpg, thunderstorm.png, fewclouds.png, snow.png, rain.png, drizzle.png, clear.png, atmosphere.png must be saved in this location: src/assets/backgrounds

Once those are set up the application should work and display all feautures, like the ones shown in the video
